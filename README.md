                                                   Weather App Project Report
                                                   Real-Time Weather Dashboard
Overview: An elegant weather monitoring application integrated with OpenWeatherMap API for accurate meteorological data. Core Features: Location-based weather updates, forecast visualization, and temperature unit conversion

Introduction:
The Weather App is a simple web application that helps users check the weather in any city. It uses an online service to get real-time weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The app is designed to be easy to use and visually appealing. This project helps understand how to fetch data from an online source and display it on a webpage.

Objective:
The main goals of this project are:
•	To create a simple weather application that is easy to use.
•	To fetch real-time weather data from an API and display it.
•	To design a webpage that looks good on different screen sizes.
•	To help users quickly check the weather by entering a city name.
•	To improve understanding of web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API usage.
Methodology:
The Weather App was made using different web technologies. The steps to build it are:
•	HTML: Used to create the basic structure of the webpage.
•	CSS: Used to design and style the webpage to make it look nice.
•	JavaScript: Used to fetch data from the weather service and update the webpage.
•	OpenWeather API: A free online service used to get weather data for different locations.
•	Pexels Video API: Used to add a background video to make the app look more attractive.
Steps Taken:
1.	Created a simple webpage layout using HTML and CSS.
2.	Connected the webpage to the OpenWeather API using JavaScript.
3.	Fetched weather details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions.
4.	Displayed the weather data dynamically based on user input.
5.	Added animations and background video for a better visual experience.
6.	Tested the app on different devices to ensure it works well everywhere.
   
Code and Implementation Details:

The Weather App has different files that work together:
•	HTML File (index.html): Contains the layout of the app, including the search bar and weather display sections.
•	CSS File (style.css): Adds colors, fonts, and styles to make the webpage look nice.
•	JavaScript File (script.js): Fetches data from the API and updates the webpage.
•	Configuration File (config.js): Stores the API key needed to access weather data.

Results and Observations:
•	The app can successfully get and display weather details.
•	Users can check the weather by typing the city name.
•	The background video makes the app look modern and interactive.
•	The design is responsive and works well on phones, tablets, and computers.

Conclusion:
The Weather App is a great way to learn about web development. It shows how to use JavaScript and APIs to make a dynamic webpage. The project helps improve skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API usage. Future improvements could include more features like a five-day forecast, changing temperature units, and automatically detecting the user’s location.
